## Introduction

Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating various medical conditions. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) are two common file formats used for storing medical imaging data.

This project provides examples and utilities for handling both DICOM and NIfTI files using PyDICOM and NiBabel libraries. With these libraries, you can easily read, visualize, and manipulate medical imaging data in your Python applications.

## DICOM

DICOM is a standard format for storing and transmitting medical imaging data. PyDICOM is a Python package that provides functionalities for reading, modifying, and writing DICOM files. It allows you to extract various information from DICOM files such as patient information, imaging modalities, and pixel data.

## NIfTI

NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) is a file format commonly used for storing neuroimaging data. NiBabel is a Python library that allows you to read and write NIfTI files. It provides a consistent interface for working with NIfTI files, making it easy to extract metadata and voxel data from neuroimaging datasets.
